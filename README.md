Machine Learning From Scratch with NumPy
Welcome to Machine Learning From Scratch, a comprehensive repository where I implement core machine learning algorithms and concepts directly from first principles using pure Python and NumPy. This project focuses on understanding and building ML foundations from the ground up, without relying on high-level ML libraries.

ðŸš€ About
This repo is dedicated to demystifying machine learning through hands-on implementation of essential algorithms using only:

Mathematical formulas

NumPy for numerical computations

Python for clear, straightforward code

You'll find implementations for:

Supervised learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

Classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy)

Regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, RÂ² Score)

Other important utilities and helper functions

With this project, I aim to provide learners and enthusiasts a solid understanding of how ML algorithms really work under the hood.

ðŸ’» Features
Detailed, math-backed implementations of ML algorithms

Metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score implemented from scratch

Error and performance metrics such as MSE, RMSE, Accuracy, and RÂ² Score

Clear, commented code for easy learning and customization

No dependencies except NumPy â€” no scikit-learn or TensorFlow used

ðŸ“š Topics Covered
Data preprocessing and handling

Regression models: Linear Regression and evaluation

Classification models: Logistic Regression and evaluation metrics

Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1 Score, MSE, RMSE, RÂ²

Understanding the math behind these algorithms and metrics

ðŸ”§ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-from-scratch.git
cd ml-from-scratch
Install NumPy if you donâ€™t have it already:

bash
pip install numpy
Run scripts directly with Python.

ðŸ›  Usage
Import the functions or classes and use them in your projects or experiments. Example for using the precision function:

python
import numpy as np
from precision import precision

y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
y_pred = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0])

print("Precision:", precision(y_true, y_pred))
ðŸ“– References
Detailed explanations of metrics and algorithms are in the code comments aligned with fundamental mathematical formulas.

Inspired by standard textbooks and courses on machine learning and statistical learning theory.
